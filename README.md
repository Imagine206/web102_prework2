## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The Challenges i faced making the page was putting the keys together even when i have the answer down, I'm always of by a letter or 2. The reduce and filter function where a bit difficult to understand at first but after reding some of the materials and practicing how to use the functions it got easier. The destructuring part also had me confused a lot!!, I was lost for a while and it took me way longer to understand than it did when i was learning the reduce and filter functions.
